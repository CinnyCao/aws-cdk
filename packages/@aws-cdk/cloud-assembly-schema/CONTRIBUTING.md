## Cloud Assembly Schema

Making changes to this module should only happen when you introduce new cloud assembly capabilities.

> For example: supporting the `--target` option when building docker containers.

If you decided these changes are necessary, simply go ahead and make the necessary modifications to the interfaces that describe the schema. Our tests and validation mechanisms will ensure you make those changes correctly.
